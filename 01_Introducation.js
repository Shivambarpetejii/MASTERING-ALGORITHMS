// Introducation :- An algorithm is finite sequence of well-defined instructions that takes some input, performs a series of steps, and produces an output to solve a specific problem.
        //ðŸ‘‰ Example:--- Problem: Find the largest number in a list.
            // Algorithm (Step by Step):-- 
                                        //1. Assume the first number is the largest.
                                        //2. Compare it with the next number.
                                        //3. If the next number is larger, update the "largest".
                                        //4. Repeat until the list ends.
                                        //5. Return the largest number.
